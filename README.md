Kubernetes User versus Admin

**Admins**

Set up and Configuration 

> Provisioning
> Networking
> Access
> Permissions

- Create AWS Account
- Install Jenkins / Install Plugins
- Configure Access
- Secure

**Users**

Usage of platform

> Deploying Applications
> And Services

- Pipeline 
- Deploy to AWS 

Fundamental Concepts

1. Learn why Kubernetes is used
   
   - What problems does Kubernetes solve?
   - What are the issues when operating large conteinerized applications?
   - What are the benefits of using Kubernetes?

2. How Kubernetes solves these problems

Architecture

> Control plane
> Worker nodes
> What processes run on the control plane and worker nodes?

3. Core Objects in k8s

- What is a pod ?
- What is a service ?
- What is a config map ?
- What is a secret ?
- What is a ingress ?
- What is a deployment ?
- What is a stateful set ?
- What is a namespace ?
- What is a volume ? 

4. Kubernetes Components 

- Control Plane
  
> Scheduler
> Controller manager
> Etcd
> Api Server

- Worker Nodes

> Kubelet
> Kube-proxy
> Container runtime

5. Access and interact with Kubernetes

- Learn Kubectl and its main commands 

- Creating, modifying, deleting resources, querying the cluster's state and status

6. Kubernetes Manifest files

- Learn syntax of kubernetes manifest files
- Declarative way of creating kubernetes objects
- Specifying what resources should exist and how they should be configured
- How to create and manage these configuration files

7. Troubleshooting Kubernetes

- Learn kubectl troubleshooting commands
- How to get insight into the cluster's state and status
- Insights ogf cluster networking, component configuration, etc

8. Common Kubernetes Misconfigurations

- Learn about common misconfigurations 
- What and why to avoid 
- Teaches you more about how kubernetes works 

9. Helms Charts 

- What is Helm ?
- What are Helm charts ?
- What are the used for ?

- Secure any secret data 

14. Kubernetes Operators 

- Essential for managing stateful applications ( Database, message brokers, etc)
- Learn to deploy and use Operators 

15. Monitoring 

- Setup third party logging, monitoring and alerting system
